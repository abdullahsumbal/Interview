# Edge computing:
 computation done close to the device (sensor) so it can reduce the amount of work done by the processor in cloud

# Fog computing:
Edge and the network to get the dat to its final destination

# Security Edge:
  Some argue that security is theoretically better in an edge computing environment because data is not traveling over a network, and itâ€™s staying closer to where it was created.

  The flip side of that is some believe edge computing is inherently less secure because the edge devices themselves can be more vulnerable.

  # My experience:
    GE, talk about nodes and how some data was processed on the nodes like uptime. then Send to the gateway. where the data was compiled and send to the cloud once compiled.

  ### Some Definition:
  1. Fat client: Software that can do some data processing in edge devices. This is opposed to a thin client, which would merely transfer data.

  2. Mobile edge computing: This refers to the buildout of edge computing systems in telecommunications systems, particularly 5G scenarios.

  3. Distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems. A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which then communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another

  # From website:
  1. practical Al
  2. what is the low touch network management model - > their goal
  3. They use AI to solve problems like traffic management, hardware failure prediction. root cause analysis  and impact analysis (customer). Now imagine all there service are on a different network and machine it is not feasible to apply AI to these services. not scalable. So they created a network chaining so that different deferent aspects of the network can share context and use AI. they call it AI chaining.

  Predicting resources allocation for a service can save companies alot of many. if something is over provisioned then we will lose money.


  1. what positions? what kind of work is expected for interns.
  2. what skills you are looking for in a candidate?
  3. can you tell me about low touch network management model?
  4. you have different branches?
  5. you are a new company? who is your competition?
  6. what's your favorite part of working here?
