# Questions
1. (done)How large is an island in a 2d matrix of 1s and 0s (1=land, 0=water)
2. (done)DFS, array
3. (done)Describe a project you have worked on that involved C/C++ (problem, goal, algorithm, etc.)  
4. (done)Basic programming questions.
5. (done)What do you know about Intel PSG group?  
6. (done)Graph, DP, and design questions  
7. (done)Basic algorithm design/data structure questions. I was asked a tree and a graph question and had to implement a few related algorithms.  
8. (done) what is binary tree?  Yes
9. (done) graph questions. how to traverse a directed graph, how to create a data structure to store the graph. code the traversal. i have a feeling graph questions are important here. probably because a lot of the CAD algorithms use graphs and the Toronto location has a huge team that does CAD.  
11. (done)find a circle in linked list  
12. There are about 3 billion positive 32 bit integers that can exist, you are given 1 billion integers and you run them one by one through an ancient cpu with very limited storage capacity (can store like a few thousand integers at most). You can run the 1 billion numbers through the cpu as many times as you like. You must be able to determine 1 number that wasn't among the 1 billion integers provided.  
13. (done) 1- You have a Tree (not BST), find the third maximum element.
2- Given an array of numbers, nums, return an array of numbers products, where products[i] is the product of all nums[j], j != i.

Input : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [(2*3*4*5), (1*3*4*5), (1*2*4*5), (1*2*3*5), (1*2*3*4)]
      = [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]
You must do this in O(N)  
14. A code to calculate the maximum possible outcome from summing k numbers from a random string of numbers length n.  
15. Design almost the same algorithm in software.  
16. find the longest path of a tree
17. Difference between call by value and call by reference  
18. (done) traverse binary tree  
19. find repetitive number in an array  
20. An array input of building heights, calculate the volume of water will be stored if it rains  
21. traversal a tree  
22. Graph algorithm question: find a shortest spanning tree in a graph.  
23. Given a 2D array, return the letter that has the largest chained area  
24. Design a sequence detector  
25. (done)We have a binary tree. How do we find the longest path (path with the most number of nodes) starting from the head? Part 2: how do we find the longest path that starts from a child and ends at another child and doesn't necessarily pass the head?  
26. We have a graph of nodes (devices) and edges that determine the delay between connected nodes. Find the critical delay path using C or C++, only give the delay number, don't have to return the whole path.  
27. Implement a 2-bit Gray Code counter and draw schematic. How do we determine critical clock frequency, and why don't we consider hold time in this calculation? Given these numbers, find the critical clock freq. How can we clock the circuit at a faster rate if we add delays on this Gray Code counter you implemented.  
28. Draw a circuit that takes an input signal, delays it by one clock cycle and extends it to 2 clock cycles.  
29.(done) How to delete a node from a binary search tree.  
30. Given an array of integers, find the maximum sum that can be formed by three consecutive elements.  
31. Given an array of integers, find a peak element in it  
32. Asked to make a C++ Unit test-case pass. Asked questions on Multi-threading, Mutexes, Deadlocks, Challenges faced in the previous projects and how I resolved them, OOPs concepts (basic level)
33. Describe Operator Overloading
34. Difference between Hash Map and Hash Set  
35. Factory Design Pattern and several others on my resume.  
36. They asked me what was volatile in C and a few low level questions relating to operating systems.  
37. Given an array, write a method that prints the sum of every third value(index 0-2, index 1-3...so on).
38. What is ISR  
39. you are given a list of names, some of the names are "parents" and all above them until the next parent are their children. names can appear multiple time ( a parent who is also a child to another parent)
tell us how you can build a data structure to access any name and know who are his parents  
40. you are given an infinite array of integers(means negatives and zero included), find the longest series that it's sum is the largest
41. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
42. Reverse the order of the words in a given sentence  
43. Find and count duplicate elements between 2 unsorted arrays
44. Given a array containing integers in pairs, find the only integer in the array that does not come in pairs  
45. (Dont understand)given a binary tree, and a number in each node. Select the nodes that will maximize the overall sum such that if a node is selected its parent and children cannot be selected. Return the sum of the selected nodes  
46. SW: recursive algorithms
HW: designing a digital circuit that detects several consecutive "1" bits.
47. Given a tree of 2-bit adders (no branching and looping), how would write an algorithm to reduce its over all delay?  
48. Given two integer arrays, write a function which can compute the product of first array and save in the second array, except the product of that particular element from first array of same index you currently store in second array.

A = [a(0), a(1), a(2), a(3) ... a(n)]
B = [b(0), b(1), b(2), b(3) ... b(n)]

where

b(0) = a(1) x a(2) x a(3) .... x a(n)
b(1) = a(0) x a(2) x a(3) ....â€¦
49.
- The buildings in a a city can be represented in 2D by linear array. Given an array that represents the heights of the buildings such that the value in a specific index in the array indicates the height of the building at that location in the city. How much rain will gather in the city if it rains?



### Second Round:

1. brush up on tree? (traversal)
2. brush up on graph? (traversal)
3. DP
4. C++/C concepts
5. What do you know about Intel PSG group
6. Draw a circuit that takes an input signal, delays it by one clock cycle and extends it to 2 clock cycles.  
Ans: I used 2 D flip-flops and an OR gate, first flip-flop for the delay and second one for extending the high input to 2 clock cycles. OR the delayed input with the output of the second flip-flop for your final output.
7. How large is an island in a 2d matrix of 1s and 0s (1=land, 0=water)
8. A problem similar to consumer-producer problem in OS  
9. What is static and dynamic polymorphism?  (brush up on inheritance)
