The Intel Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) offers FPGAs, SoC FPGAs, CPLDs and complementary power solutions to accelerate a smart and connected world.

FPGA: A field programmable gate array (FPGA) is a semiconductor device containing programmable logic components and programmable interconnects. It can be programmed or reprogrammed to the required functionality after manufacturing

FPGA is opposite of ASIC.

FPGA are made up of
CLB (configurable logic blocks)
Reconfigurable interconnects
I/O block
Fixed function logic block (multiplier)
Block RAM


SoC: System on chip. They used in smartphones. They contains almost thing in one chip like
CPU,
GPU
DSP: digital processing unit used for video and audio
Memory
Connectivity module: WIFI, bluetooth

CPLD: Complex Programmable logic Device. They are same as FPGA but has EEPROM Flash instead of logic blocks


How FPGA are different from microcontroller?

In a microcontroller, we upload a piece and to do a certain task. On the other hand in FPGA we define the hardware to do a certain task. Can perform task in parallel.

 FGPA over GPU
The great thing about FPGA is that it can run DNN at low power.
Advantages:
Low Latency: this is why FPGA is used in jet planes
Connect data source to any pin and high bandwidth.
Disadvantages:
	FPGA are much harder to program in hardware
	But they can use HLS and openCL  compiler which makes it easier
Energy efficiency: This is true for fixed point but not for floating points.

The two things holding back FPGA is the compile time and floating point computation.


What is opencl?
This is specification to facilitate parallel computing

What is HLS?
The IntelÂ® HLS Compiler is a high-level synthesis (HLS) tool that takes in untimed C++ as input and generates production-quality register transfer level (RTL) code that is optimized for Intel FPGAs
