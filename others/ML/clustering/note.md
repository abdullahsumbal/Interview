# Clustering

Up till now we have been doing supervised learning. Now clustering comes into play. Now the machine is given a bunch of data and clusters data into groups and give it labels.

There are two types of clustering
1. Flat clustering : you tell the machine how many clusters you want
2. hierarchal clustering: the machine itself figures out how many clusters it want

For flat clustering
  K-mean if k =3
  step 1: find 3 random points (feature set). those are your centroid
  step 2: find the closet point
  step 3: find center of all groups (orange circle)

  repeat step 2 and 3.
