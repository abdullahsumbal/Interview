# Why use FPGA for machine learning and deep learning
1. power efficient implementation:
2. Dynamtic and can be reconfigured 


To implement the modulo circuit you should use a couple of useful tricks to simplify the computations. Trick #1 -circuits for implementingdivisionoperations tend to be large (many gates) and slow. Thus, you should avoid using division if possible, except for division by numbers which are powers of 2. Integer division by 2^N is performed simply by right-shifting N places.e.g. 203/8 = 11001011/1000 = shift_right(11001011,3) = 00011001 = 25But we have to divide by 13, which is not a power of 2! What do we do???Trick #2 –instead of dividing by 13, we can multiply by (1/13). Then, approximate (1/13) by a ratio of integers, where the denominator is a power of 2. Use the smallest numbers that will give a good approximation. In this case we can approximate (1/13) by (5/64), (which uses the smallest possible numbers that yield an accuracy sufficient for our neeed to compute floor(A/13)we need only compute shift_right(A*5,6). Since the shifting operation gets rid of the fractional part of the division, the floor operation comes for free.e.g. floor(37/13) = shift_right(‘100101’ * ‘101’,6) = shift_right(‘10111001’,6) = ‘10’ = 2Once we have computed floor(A/13) we need to multiply by 13 and then subtract the product from A. So, we have to do two multiplications in total –once by 5 and once by 13. This leads us to our final trick for this lab
