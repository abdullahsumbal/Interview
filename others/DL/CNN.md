# Convolution Neural Network:

### 1. it is forward propagation network
### 2. Convolution Layer:

performs Convolution with a filter matrix which gives us a Convolved Feature

### 3. ReLu Layer:
 then we perform the ReLu. Note that the images goes through multiple filters and Relu
ReLu layer provides a Rectified feature maps.
